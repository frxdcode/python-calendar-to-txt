# Python Calendar to Text File

This Python script generates a calendar for a specified year and saves it as a `.txt` file with a timestamped filename. The user is prompted to enter a year, and the script then generates the calendar for that year using Python's built-in `calendar` module, and saves it to a text file with a formatted filename.

## Features
- Prompts user for the year.
- Generates a full calendar for the entered year.
- Saves the calendar in a text file with a timestamped filename.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
3. Run the Python script.

```
python generate_calendar.py
```

4. Enter the year for which you want to generate the calendar when prompted.
5. The script will generate the calendar for the specified year and save it as a text file in the following format:

```
Calendar for <year> - Generated by Python on <timestamp>.txt
```

For example:
```
Calendar for 2025 - Generated by Python on 2025-01-25 10-30-00.txt
```

6. The generated text file will contain the full calendar for the specified year.

## Example

```bash
Enter year for which you want to generate calendar: 2025
```

This will create a file named something like:
```
Calendar for 2025 - Generated by Python on 2025-01-25 10-30-00.txt
```
